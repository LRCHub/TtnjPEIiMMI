Steady bumping LL Cool J instrumentals
Probably as often as Andre drawing them album covers
For the record I'm here to spit a lot more than sixteen
Flowing hot like a forehead with a fever
Except I didn't need it to have sick dreams
The way the music make me feel, I might as well be rapping til I'm 50
Scratch that, 60
Need an old classic ride something from the 60s
Scratch that, 50s
You know them old Porsche Spyders with no ceilings just like me
Hundreds of views to my name I'm an unknown thing
The way the music make them feel I'm an uncrowned king
Until the days that I'm praised for the words I sing
Yeah
Them days remain far away
The castaway that found his way and built a better place
From nothing to something built by confidence and faith
Shrugging the struggle off they'll never see it in my face
But they could hear it in the voice
Under 5'9 might be the best conscious rapper since Royce
Songwriting for days, I'm nice cause I do it by choice
These rappers do it for likes which don't result in much noise
Damn
I call it how I see it
Practically a referee, but I was born to play the game
Ever since Rumination I just can't rap the same
Throw my standards in a plane, squad around me like a diamond chain
Perspective is different than most people my age
Do underlying characteristics in people change
Y'all go too slow for my liking so now I'm switching lanes
My conclusion remains we just ain't built the same

My conclusion remains we just ain't built the same

Steady bumping, knock the hustle instrumental
Cole spit verses for Cozz on there and now Im writing to it
Ain't that some cause and effect
Deeper than just a feature on that Cozz and Effect
Sometimes I feel like, I just rap for respect
Treat the beat like a mirror in other words allow myself to reflect
Thoughts I'm forcing myself to recollect
How the fuck they making music strictly for the internet like
I need to get to all these shows
Test out all these flows
I could give a shit about the money and the fame and the parties and the hoes
Its living out the dream vs proving I was chose

Living out the dream verse proving I was chose
